The advent of the internet and digital technologies has had a profound impact on many paper-based traditions and communication methods. The postcard industry is one such field that has faced a sharp decline due to this revolutionization. This decline in the postcard industry has been affecting various sectors and individuals, eventually leading to a dying culture. To combat this decline and potentially revitalize the postcard industry, it is crucial to explore innovative solutions. One potential approach is to blend the traditional charm of postcards with the ease and convenience provided by digital communication. This way the business could adapt to the ever-evolving consumer preferences and ensure a continuation of cherished cultural practices. Therefore, making the postcards accessible through an e-commerce platform can potentially address and reverse this decline by making them available to people all over the world. This can be achieved with the utilisation of  “Inked Memories”, a dedicated application intended for online purchase and ordering of postcards. Moreover, the application comes with attractive features upholding and meeting the digital demands of today.
